# Scripts
Here, you'll find a collection of my scripts.<br/>
Feel free to send issues if you think I should improve one.

## Before you run anything
Here 3 things you need to know before running my scripts :
- 1.DO NOT RUN in production or serious business ! <br/>
(If you want to do it anyway, i'm not responsible for any damage)
- 2. Never run with root. If admin rights are needed, I use sudo.
- 3. The first line of every scripts is always like that : <br/>
```
figlet "The application or purpose of the script" | lolcat
```
If you don't want that, comment it by adding a `#` at the start of the line.
- 4. You are free to use these scripts, but if you don't know what you're doing, try to research and understand at least the basics.

## Happy Linuxing
