# Scripts
Here, you'll find a collection of my scripts.<br/>
Feel free to send issues if you think I should improve one.

## Before you run anything
Here 4 things you need to know before running my scripts :
- DO NOT RUN in production or serious business ! <br/>
**(If you want to do it anyway, i'm not responsible for any damage)**
- Never run with root. If admin rights are needed, I use sudo.
- The first line of every scripts is always like that : <br/>
  `figlet "The application or purpose of the script" | lolcat`. <br/>
  If you don't want that, comment it by adding a `#` at the start of the line.
- You are free to use these scripts, but if you don't know what you're doing, try to research and understand at least the basics.

## Happy Linuxing
